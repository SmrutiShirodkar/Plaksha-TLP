Dear Tojo,

Thank you so much for how often you have helped me with learning things I struggled with. Those might have been very little but whatever you taught has inscibed in my mind. This has
really helped me take up more challenges than I would. Be it solving a rubik's cube or math problems or simply find a different perspective for any idea, I was much benefitted. I also really appreciate how you have been patient with me throughout. I realize that you have spent alot of your time in helping me with my problems. Your actions show me that you really care about other people's growth and I really like that about you. I want to thank you for all you have done. You are my an inspiration to me.

Gratefully,
Smruti
